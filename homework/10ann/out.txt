--------
Part a)
Making training points..
Making interpolation with 4 neurons...
Interpolation can be seen in Interpolation.svg
--------
Part b)
Figures with interpolations and derivatives have been made. Both with Cos(5x-1)*exp(-x^2) and sin(x).
--------
Part c)
Added option of training for solving differential equation.
Training on function u''+u=0 from 0 to 2pi with y(0)=0 and y'(0)=1...
As can be seen on the plot DiffEqSin.svg, this results in a sine function, as expected.
Training on function u''+u=0 from 0 to 2pi with y(pi)=-1 and y'(pi)=0...
As can be seen on the plot DiffEqCos.svg, this results in a cos function, as expected.
