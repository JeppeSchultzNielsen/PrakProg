Part A
Making training points..
Making interpolation with 7 neurons...
Interpolation can be seen in Interpolation.svg

Part B
Figures have been made. Both with Cos(5x-1)*exp(-x^2) and sin(2x).
Calculating integral can be done in a very stable way. 1st derivative looks somewhat convincing, 2nd derivative is very bad.
This is fair because we are really limited by few gaussian wavelets, which may have extreme second derivatives.
