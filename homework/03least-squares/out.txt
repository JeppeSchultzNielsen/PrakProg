-------
Part a)
A linear fitter has been made...
It's tested in part b)
-------
Part b)
Making fit to Rutherford and Soddy's data...
Covariance matrix:

   0.00115   0.000178 
  0.000178   4.83e-05 
fitted T1/2 = 4.08E+0 +- 2E-1 d, modern value is 3.6319+-0.0023 d.
Means we're not entirely within an errorbar of modern value.
-------
Part c)
Creating exponential decay data with parameters shifted by the errors from the covariance matrix...
Result can be seen on Fit.svg.
